> Fallah is a mobile app made to assist Farmers in selling their produce more efficiently and with minimal loss/ food waste. Fallah was designed to be user friendly for Farmers; just snap a pic and add the details of your harvest, and you're good to go!
>
> On the other hand, shop owners. Shop owners have to physically purchase all their products, this means waking up at dawn everyday and lets face it, everyone likes sleep. Back to Fallah, shop owners will access all the products that the Farmers have uploaded, and will be able to order two types of orders, Regular Order or Scheduled Order.

### User Stories

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/). Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment, and express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- For the database, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) was used as it allows the app to run smoothly and efficiently, in addition to being able to create custom interactive Data charts for user insights.
- For the design, [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) were used.
- The app uses the font ["Inter"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
